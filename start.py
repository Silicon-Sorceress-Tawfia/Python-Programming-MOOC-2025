'''Let's begin programming by getting familiar with the print command, 
which prints text. In this context, 
printing essentially means that the program will show some text on the screen.

The following program will print the line "Hi there!":'''

print("Hi there!");

'''The program will not work unless the code is written exactly as it is above.
For example, trying to run the print command without the quotation marks, like so

print(Hi there!)'''
